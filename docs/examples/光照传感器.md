  Photoresistor (Light Dependent Resistor, LDR) Example

  This code reads the analog value from a photoresistor connected to A0 on an Arduino Uno and 
  prints the light level to the serial monitor.

  Circuit:
  - The photoresistor is connected to the A0 pin of Arduino Uno at one end, and the ground (GND) pin of Arduino at the other end.
  - One end of a 10k ohm resistor is connected to the A0 pin, and the other end is connected to the +5V pin on Arduino (10k ohm can be replaced with other resistor values).

                              GND
                             
  The photoresistor and a 10kΩ resistor form a voltage divider. The A0 pin reads the voltage drop across the photoresistor, which changes according to light intensity.

## **Light sensor**

!https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/light_sensor_bb.svg

Have a [**`LightSensor`**](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_input.html#gpiozero.LightSensor) detect light and dark:

```python
**from** **gpiozero** **import** LightSensor

sensor = LightSensor(18)

**while** **True**:
    sensor.wait_for_light()
    print("It's light! :)")
    sensor.wait_for_dark()
    print("It's dark :(")
```

Run a function when the light changes:

```python
**from** **gpiozero** **import** LightSensor, LED
**from** **signal** **import** pause

sensor = LightSensor(18)
led = LED(16)

sensor.when_dark = led.on
sensor.when_light = led.off

pause()
```

Or make a [**`PWMLED`**](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_output.html#gpiozero.PWMLED) change brightness according to the detected light level:

```python
**from** **gpiozero** **import** LightSensor, PWMLED
**from** **signal** **import** pause

sensor = LightSensor(18)
led = PWMLED(16)

led.source = sensor

pause()
```
