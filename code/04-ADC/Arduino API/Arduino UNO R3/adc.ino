  Analog Input to PWM LED Brightness Control

  This code reads the analog value from an analog input (e.g., a potentiometer) connected to pin A5 
  and converts it to a PWM signal that controls the brightness of an LED connected to pin 11.

  Circuit:
  - Analog input (e.g., potentiometer) connected to A5.
  - One side of the potentiometer connected to 5V, the other side connected to GND.
  - Middle pin of the potentiometer connected to A5 (analog input).
  - LED connected to pin 11 through a 220Î© resistor.

  The analog input (A5) reads the voltage from the potentiometer and converts it into a brightness value for the LED using PWM.
