  STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) ADC with PWM LED Control

  This code reads the analog value from a potentiometer or analog sensor connected to PA0 (A0) 
  and converts it to a PWM signal that controls the brightness of an LED connected to PB1 using PWM.

  Circuit:
  - Analog input (e.g., potentiometer) connected to PA0 (A0).
  - One side of the potentiometer connected to 3.3V, the other side connected to GND.
  - Middle pin of the potentiometer connected to PA0 (A0).
  - LED connected to PB1 through a 220Î© resistor.

  The analog input from PA0 (A0) is read, and its value is mapped to control the brightness of an LED using PWM on PB1.
